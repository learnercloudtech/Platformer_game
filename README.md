# Platformer_game
This project aims to design and develop a 2D platformer game using Python and 
Pygame, where players must navigate increasingly complex levels filled with tricky 
platforming challenges and environmental puzzles. The key issue addressed is the 
need for innovative mechanics that promote creative problem-solving and precise 
movement while avoiding combat and enemies. A unique feature of the game is the 
use of water as a resource, which restores the player's life, encouraging careful 
resource management. The game also promotes water conservation as an 
educational message, aiming to raise awareness about the importance of water 
through its gameplay mechanics and challenges.
